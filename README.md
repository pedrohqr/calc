# Matrix Calculator - until `C++23`
## Breaf Description
In order to explore the `Modern C++` features, we work on this project that is capable to calculate matrix problems, eg. sum, product, transpose, etc. The objective could be trivial, but was exploit somes of C++ features like **templates**, **lambda expressions**, **smart pointers**, **STL functions**, etc.
Moreover, was used built in functions, such that the user can write any function in external file to be aplied in runtime, that is very versatile.
